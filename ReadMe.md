#   **Data Structures and Algorithms**
_A repository of concepts, implementations and applications of this behemoth of a topic of study. This is not an interview prep guide._

##  **Introduction**
An algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous and computationally executable sequence of instructions.

A Data structure is a method of storing and organizing data. 

##  **Data Structures and its Types:** 
    
Depending on the situation, it is important to choose the right data structure.

Types of datastructures:
    
*   **Linear DS:**  The elements are arranged in a sequence.

    Popular linear datastructures:






*   **Non-Linear DS:**  Elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element might be related to one or more elements.
